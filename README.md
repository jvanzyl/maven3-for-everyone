# Maven 3.x for everyone!

Maven 2.x is not being actively developed, and while Maven 3.x is intended to be a drop in replacement I have heard people mention they have blockers moving to Maven 3.x. I'd like to know exactly what they are, get some sample projects and try to eliminate as many of the remaining issues as possible.
